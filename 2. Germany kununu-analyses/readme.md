# Let´s find out which employer-benefits are important

Leveraging key-datascience skills and interactive visualizations to analyse the german employer-landscape:

Used skills & techniques like:

- webscrapping of more than 8000 datapoints with Python´s beatifulsoup4 (bs4)
- ggplot2 to make cool visualizations
- shiny to make interactive graphs
- data.table to create an interactive table

**Note from the future:** Oh god, I just had a look on the old code (especially the Web Scrapping Script) and I don´t believe 
I have EVER seen such bad Code (who does function decleartions inside of a for loop? :D ).

Anyway, I will keep it un-refactored so I can see where I come from and how my skill level is advancing every day :)
